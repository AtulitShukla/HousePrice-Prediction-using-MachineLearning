# HousePrice-Prediction-using-MachineLearning
In this implementation I am using Linear and XGboost regression techniques to find solution for a regression problem namely house price prediction problem.
Steps:

1) Importing libraries
2) Reading the dataset
3) Dataset pre-processing
4) Splitting data
5) Fitting data into linear and XGboost model respectively and finding the r squared error of the same
